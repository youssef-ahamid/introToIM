# DJ board

My project consists of a buzzer, four push buttons, and one switch. Whenever a button is pressed, a note is played unique to this button. If the switch is turned on, it "records" the notes played, their duration, and pauses in between. Whenever the record button is switched back off, the notes playback as a loop.
