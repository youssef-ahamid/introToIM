# Here is the description of my hands free switch.

My circuit consists of a 330 Ohm resistor, an LED, and a gold chain. A wire connects the LED bulb to my chain and another wire is placed vertically upwards with aluminum foil wrapped around it. When my chain touches the aluminum foil current flows through my chain (since gold is an electric conductor) and closes the circuit, thus lighting the LED. The biggest problem I faced was balancing my chain (I couldnâ€™t see it because of my beard) above the aluminum foil, but practice made it easier.
