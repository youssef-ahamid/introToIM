# Interactive Observation

  The automatic doors on the left at C2 are very interesting. Whenever they were first installed, everyone was excited. They were a big upgrade from the very heavy, unpleasant semi-automatic doors that it used to be. Walking back to the dorms after a long day can make the slightest inconvenience seem like torture, and these doors made life easier for me. After a while, I started to notice a problem with its design and how it works. 

  You have to be very close to the doors for them to open, and then you would have to step back to give the doors space to open. This could not of course be solved by just increasing the range of the motion sensors connected to the doors or else the door would open whenever anyone passes by the door. This is why almost all automatic doors open sideways, and a decision to change to doors that open sideways will solve a seemingly unsolvable problem with C2â€™s automatic doors.
