## This drawing required doing a lot of geometry. Here is an image to sum it up.

## Issues
The biggest problem I ran into was the white stroke (outline) around the L's. In the original image, white strokes outlined the L's. When I tried adding strokes to the L shape, it outlined every rectangle and was further away from the original image. One solution might be drawing slightly bigger rectangles under the L shape and over the diagonal lines to give the illusion of a white stroke, but it is a very tedious task. A "strokeLeft()/strokeRight()" function would be of enourmous help, but google-ing such function gives only medical information about a stroke.
